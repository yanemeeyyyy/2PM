<p>Nichkhun Buck Horvejkul (Nichkhun) is a Thai-American that was born on June 24, 1988. He is the second oldest member of 2PM next to Jun. K so he also belongs to Hyung Line or Old Boys. Also, he is the only member of 2PM that is pure foreigner, which is why in some games of the variety shows and reality shows he appeared as a guest, he uses the "foreigner" card, especially when cornered. </p>
<p>He was scouted by JYP Entertainment at the Los Angeles Korean Music Festival while still a high school senior, despite having no singing or dancing experience. He moved to South Korea in 2006 for training and was introduced through the audition show SuperStar Survival. In 2007, he debuted in Thailand as "Khun," appearing as a backup dancer with Rain, then in 2008, he joined Hot Blooded Men, a show about trainees competing to debut in groups 2AM or 2PM. That same year, he became a panelist on the variety show Ya Shim Man Man, but left after debuting with 2PM as main visual, sub-vocalist and sub-rapper. His solo fandom color is red and in ZOO-PM, he is a koala. When it comes to his solo songs, the first song comes from the mind of his fans and his co-members is "Let it Rain".</p>
<p>Aside from that, he also made his acting debut in Thailand film "Seven Something" as a young marathon runner, then in 2013, he took on a range of acting roles across China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, and Hollywood. He starred in the Chinese series One and a Half Summer (2014), Japanese drama Kindaichi Shounen no Jikenbo (2014), and Chinese drama Looking for Aurora. He made cameo appearances in the films Forever Young and Touch the Sky - Chalui (2015). In 2017, he had his first Korean-language role in Magic School. He played a lead role in the hit Thai movie Brother of the Year (2018). Also, he starred in the Thai series My Bubble Tea (2020), winning awards for his role, and voiced characters in Big Hero 6: The Series. In 2021, he made a cameo in Vincenzo and featured in a Thai single, though he couldn't appear in the music video due to COVID-19 restrictions. In 2022, his delayed horror film Cracked was finally released, and he starred in Finding the Rainbow, earning a Best Supporting Actor nomination. In 2023, he appeared in the Hollywood romantic comedy The Modelizer, filmed in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>As someone who knows 2PM because I was at first a fan of Running Man, I find this man so handsome. Everytime he appears as a guest, I was like "POGI!!!" (So handsome!), imagine I was 12-13 years old by that time since it has been a decade since I became a fan of Running Man. No wonder he is 2PM's main visual, though all of their face cards are face carding. Then I'm so amazed by his athletic skills and competitiveness he had shown in Running Man to the point that Running Man members didn't want him as their opponent, especially in episodes where it is Running Man vs. Guests (Ep. 40, Ep. 104, Ep. 256) because he is one of the notable threats to Running Man's win. Additionally, he is one of the guests that appeared in more than five episodes, that's why members treat him as one of them. Then when I started becoming a fan of 2PM, I can tell the five of them has their own craziness, to the point that I thought Nichkhun is the opposite of the five of them because of his calm demeanor. I used to think that there's a normal member in 2PM, which is him, but I was wrong..... Sigh..... Also, along with Jun. K, he also belongs to "gym maniac gang" and often takes mirror selfies or in short, he also thirst trapping his fans.</p>
