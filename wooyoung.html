<p>Jang Wooyoung, not Jung Wooyoung from ATEEZ or Jang Wonyoung from IVE. He is Jang Wooyoung, a 2PM's main dancer and lead vocalist, that is born on April 30, 1989 in Busan. He loved dancing, but he kept this passion hidden from his father (I feel him), who strongly opposed his dream of becoming a dancer because he believed the career lacked stability. In 2007, without telling his family, he applied to JYP Entertainment’s first open audition and personally uploaded videos of himself dancing to Mgoon, an early Korean platform similar to YouTube. Competing against thousands of hopefuls, he ultimately ranked first, while future BEAST or HIGHLIGHT member, Yoon Doo-joon, who finished in second place. After relocating to Seoul to start his training with JYP Entertainment, he enrolled at the Seoul Institute of the Arts, majoring in dance. In 2009, he went on to pursue an undergraduate degree in broadcasting at Howon University, which was also attended by his bandmates Lee Jun-ho and Hwang Chan-sung.</p>
<p>In 2008, he gained public attention through Mnet’s Hot Blood Men, a survival-style program that followed trainees competing for a place in the group One Day, which ultimately resulted in the formation of 2AM and 2PM. After debuting with 2PM in 2008, the group achieved mainstream success with their second single album 2:00PM Time For Change, leading to a long and influential career marked by multiple Korean and Japanese studio albums, with Jang contributing as a songwriter and composer, including the title track “Make It.” Beyond group activities, he has remained active through fan concerts, such as the 2022 joint fan-concert 115430 with Jun. K, and ongoing performances since 2023 as part of the unofficial sub-unit ENWJ alongside Jun. K and Nichkhun.</p>
<p>He launched his solo career in 2012 with the EP 23, Male, Single, which achieved strong chart success and marked the beginning of a steady expansion of his individual artistry through music releases, collaborations, and live performances in both Korea and Japan. Over the years, he released multiple Korean and Japanese EPs and singles, many of which ranked highly on major charts, while also embarking on extensive concert tours that included milestone performances such as his first solo concerts in Korea and shows at prestigious venues like the Nippon Budokan. Alongside music releases, he participated in brand campaigns, charity projects, variety show collaborations, and special digital releases. Following his military service, he continued to evolve as a solo artist with new Japanese and Korean projects, fan meetings, and tours, culminating in recent releases and concerts in 2023–2025 that celebrated both his creative growth and major career anniversaries, while expanding his reach to new regions such as Taiwan.</p>
<p>He has built a strong presence in television and variety programming, beginning with his role as an Inkigayo MC from 2009 to 2010 and as an assistant MC on KBS’s Win Win. He later gained widespread popularity through variety shows such as We Got Married, web programs like Which Is Better?, and long-running panel and judging roles on music, dance, and competition series including I Can See Your Voice, Joseon Top Singer, Street Man Fighter, Fantasy Boys, and King of Karaoke: VS. From 2022 to 2024, he was a main cast member on Beat Coin, earning a Rookie of the Year nomination, and continued his variety career in 2025 through its successor Screwballs, along with hosting multiple YouTube web shows and co-hosting a dating program, highlighting his versatility as an entertainer, judge, and host.</p>
<p>He made his acting debut in 2011 through the KBS teen drama Dream High, where he portrayed Jason, a Korean-American character, preparing for the role by studying English with his bandmates. His performance and on-screen romance with IU drew significant attention, earning them a nomination for Best Couple at the 2011 KBS Drama Awards. He later made brief acting appearances, including a cameo with Suzy in Human Casino and a role in the idol-filled short film The Miracle in 2013. In 2024, he shared that although he passed auditions for additional acting projects, he chose to prioritize his music career over pursuing further acting roles.</p>
<p>I first saw him in Running Man (Episode 195), and everytime I see him, my first impression on him is that he is the bad boy type or gangster due to his features, and later I found out that Junho and I had the same first impression on him since Junho spoke his mind regarding that on Jun. K in Wild Beat Ep. 10. Are we meant to be? Chos! xD! But in their post-military era, he became clingy to the members, which surprised me. Anyways, he has also a dog named Denver, and he created an IG account of Denver and its username is @to.denver. Currently, he has new album and songs like Command C+Me, Paint This Love, etc. In addition, he often goes to the gym and takes mirror selfies to thirst trap his fans.</p>
