<p>Kim Junsu is Jun. K's real name, but later on, he changed his name from Junsu to Minjun due to family reasons, and he's using Jun. K as his stage name, that's why both his Twitter (X right now) and Instagram's username account is @jun2dakay ("J-to-the-U-N-K-to-the-A-Y" in his debut song <strong><em>Alive</em></strong>). He was born on January 15, 1988 and lives in Daegu. He is 2PM's main vocalist and currently, he is the eldest member of 2PM, since Jay Park, who used to be their leader and the eldest but left after a year due to circumstances, so Jun. K stands up as their leader given that 2PM, from the moment Jay Park left, has no leader. His fandom color is pink and in ZOO-PM, he is the panda.</p>
<p>Several songs of 2PM were composed by him, that's why he is called "Genius Kim", and My House is one of them, which has become viral in 2020 due to Junho's fancam on Youtube from Nuneogun. Because it became viral, My House skyrocketed the charts in Top 3 alongside Up N Down by EXID and Rollin' by Brave Girls, that's why in a variety show (Men on a Mission or Knowing Brothers), Kim Heechul, a member of Super Junior which is also a cast from the said variety show, kept teasing Jun. K that he becomes rich because of My House topping the charts and everytime that song plays, he will be teased that his bank account is full due to copyrights.</p>
<p>I first saw him in Running Man (Episode 195), and everytime I see him, my first impression on him is that he is the bad boy type or gangster due to his features, and later I found out that Junho and I had the same first impression on him since Junho spoke his mind regarding that on Jun. K in Wild Beat Ep. 10. Are we meant to be? Chos! xD! But in their post-military era, he became clingy to the members, which surprised me. Anyways, he has also a dog named Denver, and he created an IG account of Denver and its username is @to.denver. Currently, he has new album and songs like Command C+Me, Paint This Love, etc. In addition, he often goes to the gym and takes mirror selfies to thirst trap his fans.</p>
