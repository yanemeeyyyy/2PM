<section class="info">
<p>Ok Taecyeon was born on December 27, 1988 in Gangnam District, Seoul, South Korea, but emigrated at the age of 10 to Boston in 7 years, that's why aside from Nichkhun and Jun. K, Taecyeon is also fluent in English through his stay in Boston since he studied high school there.</p>
<p>In 2005, Ok’s older sister, Jihyen, encouraged him to audition for JYP Entertainment after spotting an online promotion. Though hesitant at first, he agreed, and the two traveled to New York City on his 17th birthday. A week later, he was selected as one of the final 35 contestants and was contacted with an invitation to relocate to South Korea. Ok had initially auditioned as a model, but the judges recommended that he pursue singing and dancing instead. He was later chosen as one of twelve finalists—alongside future groupmates Lee Junho and Hwang Chan-sung—to compete on Superstar Survival. Although he was the first contestant eliminated from the show, JYP Entertainment still offered him a trainee contract.
</p>
<p>In 2008, he debuted as the main rapper of a K-Pop group named 2PM, and currently, since he was born in December 1988, he is the third oldest member in 2PM, which makes him belong to Hyung Line or Old Boys, given that 2PM since 2009 until now, has six members. He is the main rapper in 2PM that's why the moment JYP's songs for 2PM were denied by all members due to the "JYP" word being included in their 2008-2013 songs, every rap part, it is automatically him. He is also one of the members who is that gutsy to roast and criticize JYP that much, which is why I love him and this group that much, and that he uses the corporate card from JYP when he was still at JYP Entertainment. His solo fandom color is green and in ZOO-PM, he is a cat, so he founded a business named Ok-Cat since Ok is his last name, and he even composed a song about Ok-Cat.
</p>
<p>In 2010, he debuted as an actor in the Korean drama Cinderella's Stepsister, then he starred at Dream High (2011), Boku to Star no 99 Nichi (2011), a Korean film named "Marriage Blue" (2013), a series title "Who Are You" (2013), Wonderful Days (2014), Assembly (2015), Bring It On, Ghost (2016), Touching You (2016), 7 First Kisses (2016), House of the Disappeared (2017), Save Me (2017), The Game: Towards Zero (2020), Vincenzo (2021), Secret Royal Inspector & Joy (2021), an action film called Hansan: Rising Dragon (2021), a crime drama named "Blind" (2022), Heartbeat (2023), XO, Kitty (2023), a Japanese film called La Grande Maison Paris (2024), and his most recent Korean drama called The First Night with the Duke (2025).</p>
