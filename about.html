<p>2PM is a South Korean boy band formed by JYP Entertainment in 2008. Originally part of a larger group called One Day, it was later split into 2AM, which focused on ballads, and 2PM, which took on a more energetic and performance-driven style. The group debuted with seven members: Jun. K, Nichkhun, Taecyeon, Wooyoung, Junho, Chansung, and Jay Park as the leader. They first gained attention with their debut song "10 Out of 10", but their breakthrough came with "Again & Again", which cemented their popularity.</p>

<p>In 2009, Jay Park left the group due to a controversy over past MySpace comments, and the group continued as a six-member act. Despite the setback, 2PM became one of the most successful K-pop acts, known for their powerful choreography and hit songs like "Again & Again," "Heartbeat," and "Hands Up." Over the years, they expanded internationally, especially in Japan since 2PM made their Japanese debut with Republic of 2PM and achieved commercial success with albums like Grown (2013), Go Crazy (2014), No.5 (2015), and Gentlemen's Game (2016), all of which ranked in the top three.</p>

<p>After touring for Gentlemen's Game, 2PM went on hiatus in July 2017 due to mandatory military service. Following their discharge in 2021, they returned with their seventh studio album, Must, released on June 28, featuring the lead single Make It, co-written by Wooyoung. The album blended jazz, pop, and electronic elements, while The Cafe incorporated R&B influences. Later, on September 29, 2021, they released their Japanese album, With Me Again.</p>
